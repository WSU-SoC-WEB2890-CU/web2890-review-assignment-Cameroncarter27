I made the font size of most of the main content of the page larger. I did this because I feel like it fills in the page a little better and thus looks nicer.
I changed the section headers of the Our Services and the Get Started sections. I did this because the new headers that I replaced the old ones with are more in-line with the purpose I have for those sections.
At the top of the section that was originally Our Services (now My Skills) I changed the format from a two column setup to a single column setup. I did this because I wanted to use the top of this section to explain what the rest of the section would be about and I decided that it made most sense to do this with a single column setup.
I removed the left column in the former Get Started section of the page. I did this because I just wanted that section to be a place for people trying to contact me to fill out the form and I didn't really need the left column for that purpose.
I made the links in the products section of the footer actually go to several of my websites. I figure having some links that take you to a full website of mine is a good idea as the pictures in the portfolio section only show the front page.
I replaced the smaller icons in the My Skills section. I did this because after changing some of the labels in that section the icons that were there didn't make sense with the skills that I outlined so I replaced them with icons that fit better.
I changed the logo on the navbar to a folder and added my name. I felt like the folder icon made sense in the case of making a portfolio and thus fit well with this site. Adding my name also seemed like a pretty obvious decision as this is my portfolio.
I gave the links in the navbar functionality so they go to their corresponding sections when you click on them. This feature is definitely a necessity when you have a navbar as it doesn't make sense to have one that doesn't really work.
I removed the phone number from the navbar as it didn't work well with the responsiveness of the site and added functionality to the Get in Touch button. I figured a button that didn't work with the responsiveness wouldn't be a good look for the portfolio so this change should help with the quality.
I changed the order of the sections so the section about my work would go before the FAQ. I did this because I felt like employers would be more pretty interested in seeing my work and thus would want to see it a little sooner in the page.
